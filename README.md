# Identification-of-Medicinal-Plants-using-CNN-Model
Identification of Different Medicinal Plants/Raw materials through Image Processing Using  Machine Learning Algorithms

 1. Collected the dataset of images containing different 
medicinal leaves.
 2. Preprocessed the collected images to enhance their 
quality and remove any noise.
 3. Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. This 
will be used to train the ML model.
 4. CNN model is used for the image recognition 
and classification.
 5. The performance of the trained model is evaluated based 
on the testing data.
 6. Common evaluation metrics for image classification 
include accuracy.
 7. Once the model is trained and evaluated, we can use it to 
predict the class labels of new unseen images of the 
plants
